# Releases

Binary releases of the Hash Auger software.

This software helps users manage their Nvidia mining rigs by setting per algorithm overclock settings and comparing algorithm/coin values across multiple pools. Using nmvl.dll, Hash Auger can monitor GPU temperature and energy usage. Advanced configuration settings can be defined per GPU using a graphical user interface. 

Hash Auger requires Windows 10 and will not run on older versions of Windows.

Hash Auger does not collect a developer fee, sell advertising or collect personal information. Donations made to the address in the software's Setup tab are greatly appreciated as this software represents hundreds of hours of personal time and work.
